District 3870 aims to mold conscientious, output driven, selfless leaders and socially aware Rotaractors that are men and women for others. Always ready to be game changers and agents of positive change. A Rotaractor that does not empower mediocrity and division, but instead empower exceptionality and unity amongst the Rotary Family.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>As the first Rotary Club in all Asia, the Rotary Club of Manila spawned the districts, and at the turn of the new millennium, the Philippines had 678 clubs and almost 20,000 Rotarians and growing. In RY 1984-1985, Rotary touched the heart of North and Central Mindanao with the creation of District 3870, a district that is truly Mindanao.</p>
                        <p>It was in 1919, fourteen years after the first Rotary Club in Chicago was organized by Paul Harris and his group, that the Philippines entered the world of Rotary with the organization of the Rotary Club of Manila. Impressed and inspired by the ideals of Rotary, a leading Manila businesswoman, the president of Lambert Sales Corp. communicated with the RI president John Poole, who sent a representative to assist in coming out with a Rotary Club in Far East. Together with the four other prominent businessmen who composed the committee to organize a Rotary Club, the organization of the club was completed with 38 charter members. On June 1, 1919, the Rotary Club of Manila, the first Rotary Club in the Philippines and Asia was granted Charter No. 478. Rotary spread quickly and before the outbreak of World War II, there were eight Rotary clubs in the Philippines, namely Manila, Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, Davao, Dagupan and Dumaguete. The war caused these clubs to be disbanded. </p>
                        <p>After the war however, several clubs were re-established and RI District 81 was created to include eleven clubs in mainland China, the Hongkong clubs and three clubs in the Philippines. As more clubs were established in the country, District 96 was created as the lone Rotary district for the Commonwealth of the Philippines. In RY 1940-1941, District 96 was renamed District 348. In RY 1957-1958 District 348 was changed to District 385. This became the Mother of all the ten Rotary Districts organized in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>It was not long before Rotary inevitably came to Mindanao. The entry of Rotary in
                            Southern Philippines was signaled by the organization of the Rotary Club of Davao in RY
                            1938-1939. On April 22, 1948, Rotary reached Northern Mindanao with the charter of the
                            Rotary Club of Cagayan de Oro, the oldest club in the district.</p>
                        <p>With the carving off and creation of new districts, District 3870 is the only district that is
                            composed of provinces from Northern Mindanao. Created by the action of the Board of
                            Directors of Rotary International in RY 1983-1984, it started as a separate administrative
                            district but was taken out of District 3850 which comprised Panay Island, Negros
                            Occidental and parts of Marawi, Cotabato, Kidapawan and the provinces of Camiguin
                            Island, Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao,
                            Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat.</p>
                        <p>While several clubs were organized through the years, a few have fallen and District 3870
                            remains the smallest district in the country. But in the heart of every Rotarian in the
                            district remain fierce commitment and fiery conviction to sweep away the power of the
                            darkness of poverty, want and ignorance by serving local and global communities above
                            personal needs. It may be the smallest, but it is closest to the hearts of and home to
                            almost a thousand dedicated Rotarians.</p>

                        <p>“Rotaract” stands for “Rotary in Action”, although the name originally comes from a
                            combination of “Rotary” and “Interact” (International + Action), the high school level
                            program created by Rotary International in 1962.
                            Most Rotaract activities take place at the club level. Rotaract clubs hold formal meetings,
                            usually every two weeks, which feature speakers, special outings, social activities,
                            discussions or visits to other clubs. Club members get together on designated days for
                            service project work, social events, or professional/leadership development workshops.</p>
